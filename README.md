I am a passionate technology enthusiast. My interests include Mobile,Web,AI and embedded hardware development. I have been developing and configuring computers from around 15 years old. My skill set is very diverse and my passion for new technologies help me learn and pick up new skills very easily. I have been known to produce high fidelity mockups and projects from very basic Business needs. This trait allows me to explore many options and software, in order to make better recommendation to our customers. This exploration process excites me and allows me to have a clear implementation strategy for all my projects.
